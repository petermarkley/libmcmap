1. generalize coordinate conversions into separate function? used redundantly in the following places:
	-= mcmap_prime_single(), lines 3054-3057
	-= mcmap_get_*() and mcmap_set_*() functions, lines 1682-1685, 1727-1730, 1781-1784
	-= certain applications
2. absorb useful application tools into libmcmap? e.g.:
	-= floating island primitive (see test.c & other private applications)
	-= diagnostic signpost
	-= chunk mover (would use coordinate converter)
